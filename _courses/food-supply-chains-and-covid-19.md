description: Covid-19 has upended food supply chains. This course examines how food
  supply chains have been impacted by Covid-19; how businesses along food supply chains
  have responded, and the pros and cons of their responses; how food supply chains
  can become more resilient to future disruptions; how resilience interacts with efficiency
  and sustainability in food supply chains; how Covid-19 compares with other potential
  future disasters in terms of impacts on food supply chains and how businesses should
  prepare; and steps that farms, agribusinesses, food companies, and governments could
  take to improve food supply chain resilience, and how those steps may impact efficiency
  and sustainability.
