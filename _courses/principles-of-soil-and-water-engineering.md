description: This course focuses on utilization and engineering of soil-water resources,
  including rainfall-runoff, soil-water movement, and erosion/sediment transport and
  flow processes. For each topic, the significance, underlying principles and equations
  are covered, along with further exploration in a practical and experiential mode
  with students sharing in problem formulation and team problem solving. Students
  are exposed to map use, representative soil profiles, cropping-management systems,
  and watershed-scale settings. Lab activities sequentially build from one lab period
  to the next, showing how each stage of soil and water engineering is used to develop
  a more complete watershed-type project.
