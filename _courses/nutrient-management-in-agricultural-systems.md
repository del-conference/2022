description: This course applies the fundamentals of animal, plant and soil sciences
  to issues arising from the intersection of livestock production with water and air
  quality. Modern regionalization and concentration of animal production systems comes
  with environmental implications due to a net influx of nutrients to livestock farms.
  While some nutrients leave the farm in the form of animal products, 60 to 70% of
  the nutrients are excreted and applied to nearby crop land. This course emphasizes
  both scientific and practical understanding of sound nutrient management principals
  and strategies. The course also covers nutrient cycling and farm-level nutrient
  management planning.
