## Project Overview

This 5-year, $9 million project funded by USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is working to create economically thriving and environmentally beneficial agricultural systems in urbanized landscapes. These agricultural systems are located in metropolitan counties and in non-metropolitan counties adjacent to metro areas, and are vital to the sustainability of U.S. agriculture. Over 60% of U.S. net farm income comes from these urbanized landscapes.

Communities and consumers in urbanized landscapes value agriculture for locally produced foods, open space and scenery amenities, recreational opportunities such as agritourism, and wildlife habitats. However, the economic and environmental sustainability of agricultural systems in urbanized landscapes is threatened by intensifying competition for land, labor, and water from urban growth and sprawl, and by water pollution, livestock odors, pests, and dust from agricultural activities.

Through close engagement and co-learning with stakeholders in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, the Thriving Ag project is developing and disseminating new technologies, management strategies, and tools for public policy-makers to achieve the long-term goal of creating economically thriving and environmentally beneficial agricultural systems in urbanized landscapes.

The Thriving Ag project is a collaborative effort involving researchers, educators, and outreach specialists at Penn State, the University of Maryland, Ohio State, Virginia Tech, and the Stroud Water Research Center, and members of the project’s Stakeholder Advisory Board.
