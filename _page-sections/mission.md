## Mission

The central hypothesis of the Thriving Ag project is that value-added agriculture of the kind required to be economically sustainable in urbanized landscapes can be achieved while enhancing ecosystem services. The mission of the project is to make this hypothesis a reality within the next 25 years, using the Chesapeake Bay watershed as a case study translatable to other urbanized landscapes.
