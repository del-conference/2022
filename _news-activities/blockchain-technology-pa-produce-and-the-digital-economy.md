description: '<p>An emerging tool could give PA wholesale growers a competitive advantage
  and reduce barriers to financial success.</p><p>It''s 2021, almost 2022, and the
  rate of technological innovation in our economy and society continues apace. What
  emerging tools could give Pennsylvania wholesale growers a competitive advantage
  and reduce barriers to financial success? Technology has transformed many aspects
  of agriculture and the economy, yet many of the business and record-keeping systems
  used by growers lag behind the digital revolution. A relatively new technology called
  <em>''blockchain''</em> has potential applications for farms and food supply chains.</p><h3>What
  is blockchain?</h3><p>Blockchain is a foundational technology on which new economic
  and legal systems can be built. It first appeared with the launch of a digital currency
  called ''Bitcoin'' about ten years ago. In a nutshell, blockchain is a tool that
  can record transactions and track information between businesses and assets across
  supply chains. Once created, transactions become part of a permanent record and
  cannot be manipulated by individual users.</p><p>One way to think of blockchain
  in the year 2021 is to compare it to the internet of the early 1990s. The use of
  the ''World Wide Web'' was very limited at that time, relative to the many sophisticated
  uses of today. Individual organizations and small networks of people experimented
  with new tools like ''Electronic Mail'' and informational websites built upon the
  early version of the ''Internet.'' Similarly, uses for blockchain like the digital
  currency mentioned above, are being created now. Many more applications of blockchain
  technology will be developed in the coming years.</p><h3><strong>Why is blockchain
  worth thinking about now?</strong></h3><p>Why was the internet worth learning about
  in the early 1990''s? New foundational technologies like the internet in the 1990''s
  – and, potentially, like blockchain now – have the ability to redefine how we relate
  to each other, conduct business, and generate financial success. Early examples
  of blockchain use in the food supply chain include giving consumers access to information
  about product origins and growing practices; automating contracts and payment processes;
  improving product and ingredient traceability; and enabling efficient cooperation
  and aggregation among producers.</p><p>Consumers want more information. Grocery
  shoppers want to ''know their farmer.'' Many surveys show that knowing how and where
  food is produced impacts consumer purchasing decisions. Blockchain technology enables
  some producers to differentiate their brand and deepen engagement with consumers.
  For example, <a href="https://www.axios.com/ibm-blockchain-olive-oil-extra-virgin-e2ab8193-9059-4858-bd44-30a226b75ffd.html"
  title="">IBM is developing a global network of olive oil suppliers and using blockchain</a>
  to trace the supply chain of their products around the world.</p><p>Blockchain may
  help producers save time and money. Automatic or <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/seansteinsmith/2021/03/24/blockchain-based-smart-contracts-considerations-for-implementation/"
  title="">''smart'' contracts built upon blockchain technology could send payment
  to a producer as soon as delivery is confirmed</a>, for example. GPS tracking, attached
  to loads of product or individual SKUs, could automatically log location updates
  and trigger additional contractual terms or provide clear chain-of-custody information
  for traceability.</p><p>Retailers might one day require participation in their blockchain
  systems. Traceability is a rising trend in wholesale produce supply chains. Traceability
  systems track product from its point of origin to the final consumer purchase, usually
  with a focus on food safety and tracking potential outbreaks of foodborne illness.
  Blockchain technology could be used here to track the quality, safety, and flow
  of products. <a href="https://www.thepacker.com/news/packer-tech/traceharvest-network-uses-blockchain-seed-retail-traceability"
  title="">TraceHarvest Network uses blockchain technology to improve identification
  and remediation during food safety recalls</a> and certify products'' origin and
  certification claims. Walmart is exploring blockchain applications in their cold
  chain, to trace <em>E. coli</em> outbreaks in lettuce for instance, to track down
  potentially contaminated product in a faster, more targeted, verifiable way.</p><p>Using
  blockchain, small producers could also better compete with large-scale or international
  producers through cooperation and aggregation. New systems for working together
  that include automatic contracts and improved traceability could satisfy the strict
  requirements of major market outlets and open new sales opportunities for grower
  networks.</p><p>PA producers planning for their business''s future will do well
  to keep blockchain technology on their radar. Long-term success requires learning
  new tools and techniques as they benefit your business and justify the costs of
  adoption. Blockchain will likely shape the digital economy of the future and impact
  PA producers'' financial success.</p><h3>Wholesale Farms and Blockchain Technology
