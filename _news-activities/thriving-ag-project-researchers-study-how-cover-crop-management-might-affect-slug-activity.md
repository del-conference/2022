title: Thriving Ag Project Researchers Study How Cover Crop Management Might Affect
  Slug Activity

description: <p>During the early spring, while collecting runoff and leaching water
  samples, Ray Weil noticed that one of their team's field sites in Maryland that
  is fine-textured and has poor drainage had a large slug infestation. Since slugs
  like to hide out under undisturbed crop residue, they are a major concern for farmers
  wishing to adopt conservation practices. Farmers have few effective controls to
  limit slug damage to young seedlings which can be so severe that the crop needs
  to be re-planted. Therefore, Ray Weil and Qianyao Si decided to take advantage of
  the slug infestation to study how cover crop management might affect slug activity.
  They, and a team of undergraduate students, studied the slug infestation for several
  weeks just before and after soybean and corn planting by counting the slugs under
  roofing shingles placed in plots as slug refuges and by rating the crop seedlings
  for damage. They collected data on soil moisture and temperature as well, since
  cool, wet condition might favor slug activity but hamper crop emergence and seedling
  growth.</p><p class="Paragraph SCXW180739362 BCX0">Their preliminary slug study
  findings include:</p><ul><li><p class="Paragraph SCXW180739362 BCX0">Prior to crop
  emergence, slug counts were higher in soybean residue than in corn residue.</p></li><li><p
  class="Paragraph SCXW180739362 BCX0">The soil under corn residue was wetter and
  cooler than soil under soybean residue.</p></li><li><p class="Paragraph SCXW180739362
  BCX0">Prior to crop emergence, cover crop did not affect slug numbers.</p></li><li><p
  class="Paragraph SCXW180739362 BCX0">Soybean damage scores averaged across rye and
  3-species mix cover crops were lower in the late cover crop kill (planted green)
  plots than in the early and mid-kill plots.</p></li><li><p class="Paragraph SCXW180739362
  BCX0">By the time trifoliate leaves developed, soybean stand counts were slightly
  higher in late-kill “planted green” plots.</p></li><li><p class="Paragraph SCXW180739362
  BCX0">The cool spring conditions delayed soybean emergence until after the late-kill
  cover had mostly desiccated. The benefit of planting green may be greater under
  conditions better for rapid soybean germination and seedling growth.</p></li></ul><p>For
