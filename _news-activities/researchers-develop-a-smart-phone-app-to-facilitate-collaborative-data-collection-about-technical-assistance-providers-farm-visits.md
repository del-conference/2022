description: <p>As part of their work to promote effective agricultural technical
  assistance, researchers with the Thriving Ag project have developed a smart phone
  app to facilitate collaborative data collection about technical assistance providers’
  farm visits. Farm visits are where technical assistance providers meet with farmers
  to discuss how best to reduce nutrient and sediment runoff and to address on-farm
  resources problems like erosion. These farm visits are a crucial step in promoting
  sustainable agriculture, because they lead to the development of conservation plans
  and help farmers seek out financial assistance for implementing conservation practices,
  such as forested riparian buffers, manure storage facilities, and grassed waterways.</p><p
  class="MsoNormal">The smart phone app – called TApp, or the Technical Assistance
  App – will provide technical assistance providers with a common platform to record
  information about their farm visits. The app will allow them to track what on-farm
  problems farmers want to address, what conservation practices they are interested
  in, and any concerns they have about the practices or application process. Once
  this information is entered into the app after a farm visit, technical assistance
  providers will be able to refer back to it and see profiles of the farmers with
  whom they work with and records of their one-on-one interactions with those farmers.</p><p
  class="MsoNormal">Currently, the Thriving Ag team is pilot testing the app with
  technical assistance providers from non-profits, conservation districts, and private
  consultancies. Once it is ready for full use, it will enable to the team to collaboratively
  test the effectiveness of different engagement strategies during farm visits. The
  hope is that this app will be both a useful tool for technical assistance providers
  to organize their work with farmers and a platform for further research on effective
  practices for engaging farmers about conservation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">For further
  questions about the mobile app, or Thriving Ag’s work on collaborating for effective
  agricultural technical assistance, please contact either Daniel Read (<a href="mailto:dread@umces.edu">dread@umces.edu</a>)
