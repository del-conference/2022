description: <p>As part of the external evaluation of the Thriving Ag Project, researchers
  from Utah State University conducted an online survey of residents of the Chesapeake
  Bay Watershed (CBW) on their views of agriculture during summer of 2021. The survey
  conducted through Qualtrics asked about respondents’ levels of awareness of and
  views on water quality issues in local streams and waterways and the Chesapeake
  Bay in general. Questions also investigated residents’ perceptions of causes of
  water quality issues, how to address water quality issues, and the future of agriculture
  in urbanized areas (including views and values placed on urban agriculture, perceptions
  of issues related to agriculture, perceptions of agricultural land loss, views on
  solutions for agricultural land loss, and attitudes about the urbanization of agriculture
  in the CBW) including scenarios developed by the Thriving Ag research team to ensure
  agriculture is economically viable and environmentally sustainable in the future.
  Over 1,100 CBW residents participated in the survey that spanned rural and urban
  areas. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iEJVCh1dRWqJLiBt7tbiQd4HH1z5T7S7/view?usp=sharing"
